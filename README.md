What is This
============

The main purpose of this software is to help to the user to dispatch unsorted
media files according meta data tags and configurable rules.


TODO
============
1. Create documentation.
2. Test more formats.
3. Make a package.
4. Add bash-completion for patterns.
5. Add default pattern picking.
6. Append extensions to the end of dispathed file.

Some warnings for future
============
1. OMF dispatching files using pathlib.Path(pattern-specified-path). Such behavior can lead to usage misunderstandings.
